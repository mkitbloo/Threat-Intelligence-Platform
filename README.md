# Threat Intelligence Platform

## Overview

The Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) is a cybersecurity solution designed to empower security analysts with enhanced tools for threat detection and intelligence generation. The platform integrates advanced threat analysis, machine learning, and user-friendly interfaces to provide a comprehensive solution for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs).

## Features

- **Network Analysis:**
  - Create a graph of traffic flow between endpoints.
  - Detect domain generation algorithms in DNS requests.

- **Interactive Visualization:**
  - Build a network overview of traffic flow between endpoints using Pyvis.
  - Dynamically tweak the physics of the graph for a customizable visualization.

- **Report Generation:**
  - Generate a detailed report of network traffic, highlighting suspicious IPs and counts.
